# Salary-Prediction
Software salary prediction using machine learning is a technique for predicting the salaries of software engineers based on factors such as education level, experience, place of residence, and 
more

## Purpose of the Project 
The purpose of this project is that it can assist businesses and individuals in better understanding the factors that drive software engineer wages and make accurate hiring and compensation decisions

## Libraries used:
### NumPy:
- NumPy is a Python library for numerical calculation that includes array operations and mathematical functions which are quick and efficient. It is popular in data analysis and machine learning applications.

### Pandas:
- Pandas is a Python data manipulation and analysis library that offers data structures for storing and processing huge datasets effectively. It is frequently used for data cleaning, processing, and analysis in data science, finance, and other fields.

### Scikit-learn:
- Scikit-learn is a Python machine learning package that includes a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, as well as model selection and assessment tools. It is commonly used to solve many machine learning problems related to data science, research, and business.

### Matplotlib:
- Matplotlib is a Python package that allows you to create visualisations such as charts, plots, and graphs from data saved in arrays or lists. It is frequently used for data exploration, analysis, and display in data science, engineering, and other industries.

### Streamlit:
- Streamlit is a Python package for creating interactive data science and machine learning web applications. It allows developers to easily construct and deploy apps that can visualise, analyse, and forecast data using machine learning models.

### Pickle:
- Pickle is a Python package that allows you to serialise and deserialize Python objects to and from a byte stream. It enables the simple storing and retrieval of Python objects from disc, as well as their transmission across a network.

## TO RUN THE APP 
- streamlit run app.py
